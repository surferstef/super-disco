Challenge: Challenge-05 Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose

This code repository is a deployment of existing HTML/CSS that started the web framework for a work scheduler. The goal of the code refactor and update was to add the UI and UX functionality to scroll and slick through a work scheduler. This application allows the user to 
(1) Reference the current time based on the color of the description box (gray = past hour, red = current hour, green = future hour)
(2) Type a schedule item in the description box
(3) Save the item by clicking a "save button"

## Built With
